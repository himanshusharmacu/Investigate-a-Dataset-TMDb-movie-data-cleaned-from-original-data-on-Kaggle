# Investigate-a-Dataset-TMDb-movie-data-cleaned-from-original-data-on-Kaggle
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 

->Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. 

->There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.

->The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

# Project Overview

-> Choosed one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigated it using NumPy and Pandas. Gone through the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing my findings.

# What do I need to install?
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv
# Why this Project?
->In this project, i have gone through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. 

-> I have used the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

# What I learned?

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
* Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings
