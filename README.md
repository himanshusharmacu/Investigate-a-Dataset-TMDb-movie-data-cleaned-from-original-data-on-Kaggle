# Investigate-a-Dataset-TMDb-movie-data-cleaned-from-original-data-on-Kaggle
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. 

->Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters. 

->There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.

->The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
